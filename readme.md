## Twitter Clone
- Create a Twitter Clone!
- Use full user authentication including:
  - [signup, login, logout]
- Full CRUD functionality for tweets
  - [Create, Read, Update, Delete]
  - User should be able to CRUD their own tweets
- A feed page that allows users to view all tweets posted by all users
- Make site responsive
- Include PROFILE pages that allow users to view only tweets made by the viewed user, as well as info about that user
### Notes
- There should be two tables: [Tweet Table, User Table]
- At least 4 pages, Login, Tweets, 2 more
- Focus on Tweets and users

- Tweet table[message, name, username, time, ]
- User table
